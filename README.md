## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

This app was inspired by a real word need of every avid mountain biker. If you are serious about mountain biking, you need to take maintenance seriously too. Keep your ride as "Ride Ready" as possible with this app! It not only serves as a reminder of when you last performed a suspension rebuild, but it also gives you an exact level of service life left since your last rebuild based on specific recommendations by each suspension manufacturer.

Ride Ready leverages a user's ride data on Strava to help them determine when their suspension needs to be rebuilt. The user logs in with Strava's OAuth2.0 authentication which grants Ride Ready access to all of their activity data and then it filters the data to only include bike rides. The app also fetches all bike data ("My Gear" in Strava settings) so that the user can specify which bike they want to create a service reminder for and then only uses ride data on that bike for the service life calculation. 

Built in 6 days for a Turing School of Software Mod 3 Showcase project. This requires a Strava account and ride data to operate.
